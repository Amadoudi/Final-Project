        <h2>What is Plastic Pollution?</h2>
        <p>  Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects (plastic bottles and much more) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans. Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro, meso, or macro debris, based on size. Plastics are inexpensive and durable, and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high. However, the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade. Together, these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the environment. </p>

        <h2>Effects of Plastics Pollution:</h2>
        <p>Plastics polltion posses even greater impacts on the environment because of its widespread usage and its durability component. Here are the impacts of the plastic pollution:
        -Implication for animals:  Plastic wastes have been mistaken for food by numerous animals, mainly marine wildlife. Large quantities of plastics have been found in the stomachs of many dead animals.
        -Implication for human health: Plastics are made up of a variety of toxic chemicals. As such, its uses and exposure are associated with a number of human health concerns.
        -Land Pollution: Plastics wastes have resulted in the destruction and decline in quality of the earth’s land surfaces in term of use, landscape and ability to support life forms. Mainly, it’s because plastics leach hazardous chemicals on land, forms breeding grounds for diseases, and litters available space thereby reducing the productive land areas.
        -Air Pollution: Often, plastics are burned in the open air. This leads to air pollution because poisonous chemicals are released into the atmosphere during combustion. Plus, when animals or humans inhale the polluted air it can affect their general well-being and cause respiratory disorders. </p>

        <h2>Are there any solutions to the plastics pollutions?</h2>
        <p> Consumers can help fix the problem by making an effort to reduce plastic waste. A great way to reduce waste is to use reusable bags when you grocery shop. People often leave stores with dozens of plastic bags that just get thrown away.

Drinking from a reusable water bottle instead of a disposable one can also be very helpful. If everyone drank the recommended amount of water per day from disposable bottles, it would create an unbelievable amount of plastic waste. </p>
